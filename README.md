This site is dedicated to the wedding of Nick Papadakis-Schneider and Cassie King. 
It is used to get rsvps from our guests and to collect guest count and type of food for our guests. It involves a Express/Mongodb backend with a React front end. 

To deploy the site locally please clone this repo and install the dependencies and then use npm run dev to run both the back and front end servers at the same time.
